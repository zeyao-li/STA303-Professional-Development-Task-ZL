Alcohols are banned on dry campuses for any age groups. Nevertheless, some alcohol drinks are still consumed on these campuses. The aim of this study is to find out what factors contribute to the alcohol drinking and whether males consume more drinks than females. The sample data is collected from a dry campus. Each observation from the data is a student who is taking an introductory statistics course. In the modeling section, a Poisson model is firstly used to model mean number of drinks by off-campus residence and sex. However, there are two distinct groups in the data, which are drinkers and non-drinkers. From the sample, these two groups could not be easily identified. Thus, a second model called zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model is used, which has the same components as the Poisson model but also accounts for the proportion of non-drinkers by using first-year status. The results show that the variables off-campus residence and sex are statistically significant since they both have p-values that are less than 0.05. By fixing other variables, average number drinks for males is 2.76 times the number for females, and average number of drinks for drinkers living off-campus is 1.52 times the numbers of those living on-campus. Furthermore, the Vuong Test suggests the ZIP model is better than the Poisson model with a p-value of 0.0036. Therefore, males and off-campus living are correlated with more alcohol drinking. Findings in this study could be useful for monitoring alcohol drinking on a dry campus. For further researches, a larger sample data could be used for analysis since the ZIP model works better with large sample size.
