Background & Aim

Alcohols are banned on dry campuses for any age groups. Nevertheless, some alcohol drinks are still consumed on these campuses. The aim of this study is to find out what factors contribute to the alcohol drinking on a dry campus and whether males consume more drinks than females.

Key findings

The estimated probability that a first year student does not drink is 0.63.
Average number of drinks for males is 2.76 times the number for females.
Average number of drinks for drinkers living off-campus is 1.52 times the numbers of those living on-campus.
Interquartile range (IQR) represents the range from the bottom 25% to top 75%Â of the drinks consumed by students. Table 1 shows this range is larger for non-first year students, which means non-first year students generally consume more alcohol drinks than first year students.
Among all dorms, Ytterboe dorm has the largest IQR for males students as shown from Figure 1.
Overall, figure 1 shows IQR is larger for males among non-first years students than females, and IQR is larger for females among first years students than males.

Limitations

The definition of alcohol drinking is vague.
Sample data only contains 77 observations, which is too small to be used in this study.
There is an issue related to confidentiality of respondents such that their responses might not be accurate.
