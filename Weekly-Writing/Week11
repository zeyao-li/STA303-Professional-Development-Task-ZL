This study investigated whether the desire to lose weight was correlated with sex, BMI, sports participation, and media exposure. The current study found that losing weight had correlations with sex and BMI. In particular, females had greater odds of wanting to lose weight than males. Meanwhile, by fixing sex, respondents were more willing to lose weight if they had higher BMI percentile. Nevertheless, neither participating in sports or watching TV had an association with interest of losing weight.

Aside from the results, some limitations arise in this study. Firstly, observations with some missing responses are not included in the method section, which might result in bias. For example, suppose there are missing information for people who watch a lot of TV, and these cases are excluded. Then, we might get biased results for correlation between interest of losing weight and lots of TV in our analysis. Secondly, the definitions of variables are limited. For instance, number of sport teams do not fully account for pressures related to sports. The pressures of losing weights for athletes who play one sport and three sports might not be the same. Meanwhile, watching TV could only represent part of total media exposure due to frequent exposure to celebrities online. Lastly, the third limitation is related to sample data. In the process of data collection, surveys could be administered by states and local authorities, which might result in selection bias. 

In conclusion, these findings may help us to understand motivations of losing weights among population. Measurements of sports participation and media exposures should be improved in order to conduct further studies.
