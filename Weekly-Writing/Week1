Peer feedback is an important aspect in the process of peer review. With peer feedback, we could receive advices and recommendations of improvements that 
we had not thought before. However, we need to be responsible for what we write. First and foremost, before giving any peer feedback, we should read through 
the whole writing. This step is very basic but crucial. If we make comments before read and try to understand the whole article, then our feedback could be 
incomplete and misleading. Secondly, any peer feedback we give should have a positive tone. For instance, while we point out issues such as grammar mistakes, 
we should also state the good aspects of the writing. Thirdly, we should try to give feedbacks on aspects that the writers have not thought about. For example, 
comment on grammar is a common type of peer feedback. Grammar feedbacks are useful, but writers might just be unsurprised. Thus, we could try to put ourselves 
in writers’ shoes and give them some ideas based on the thesis. This is similar to brainstorming and might be inspirational to the writers. 

In contrast to good peer feedback, some actions should be avoided to prevent bad peer feedback. When giving peer feedback, we should not make fun of the 
writings. Writings are difficult to be perfect, so people should be encouraged since there are always ways to make improvements. Meanwhile, the peer feedback 
should not be meaningless. For instance, it is not enough to simply write “the second paragraph could be improved”. Thus, any feedback should be targeting 
the specific writing.

Overall, good peer feedbacks help the writers to improve. When I receive my peer feedback, I hope that the feedbacks are relevant to my writing and useful.
